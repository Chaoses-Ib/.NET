> Each operation has a return value and a parameter, even if these areÂ `void`. However, unlike a local method, in which you can pass references to objects from one object to another, service operations do not pass references to objects. Instead, they pass copies of the objects.

> This is significant because each type used in a parameter or return value must be serializable; that is, it must be possible to convert an object of that type into a stream of bytes and from a stream of bytes into an object.[^serializable]
